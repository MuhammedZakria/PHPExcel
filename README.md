# Using AI to Refactor PHPExcel for PHP 8.0.28 Support

## Introduction

PHPExcel is a widely used library for working with Excel files in PHP. However, it was officially deprecated in favor of PhpSpreadsheet, and older versions of PHPExcel are not compatible with PHP 8.x due to outdated syntax and deprecated features. I recently needed to update PHPExcel to work with PHP 8.0.28, and instead of manually refactoring thousands of lines of code, I leveraged AI to make the process much easier and faster.

## The {} Array Syntax Issue in PHP 7.0.3

One of the biggest issues with older PHPExcel versions is their use of the deprecated curly brace `{}` array access syntax. In PHP 7.0.3 and earlier, it was common to see code like this:

```php
$char = $string{0};
$array{1} = "value";
```

However, in PHP 7.4, this syntax was deprecated, and in PHP 8.x, it was completely removed. The correct approach is to use square brackets `[]` instead:

```php
$char = $string[0];
$array[1] = "value";
```

## How AI Helped Me Refactor PHPExcel

Instead of manually searching for every instance of the deprecated `{}` syntax, I used AI to:

1. **Analyze the PHPExcel codebase** – AI quickly scanned the code and identified problematic syntax.
2. **Suggest automatic replacements** – Using a simple AI script or a code-aware AI tool, I converted `{}` to `[]` across the entire project.
3. **Detect other deprecated features** – AI flagged other issues, such as function signatures and usage of removed functions in PHP 8.x.

Using AI-powered code search and replacement tools, I was able to refactor PHPExcel in minutes instead of hours.

## Example: Using PHPExcel to Read Data from an Excel File

Once PHPExcel was updated, I tested it with PHP 8.0.28. Below is an example of reading an Excel file using the updated PHPExcel version:

```php
require 'PHPExcel.php';

$inputFileName = 'example.xlsx';
$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load($inputFileName);
$sheet = $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet();

foreach ($sheet->getRowIterator() as $row) {
    $cellIterator = $row->getCellIterator();
    $cellIterator->setIterateOnlyExistingCells(false);
    
    foreach ($cellIterator as $cell) {
        echo $cell->getValue() . "\t";
    }
    echo "\n";
}
```

## Conclusion

Updating old PHP libraries to be compatible with modern PHP versions can be challenging, but AI makes it significantly easier. By leveraging AI tools, I was able to refactor PHPExcel quickly, allowing it to run on PHP 8.0.28 without issues. If you’re dealing with outdated code, consider using AI to automate your refactoring process and save time.
